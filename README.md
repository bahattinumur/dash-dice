<h1>DASH DICE</h1>

This is a dice game. The game starts with "start game," and players take turns rolling dice between player 1 and player 2. The first player to reach 50 points wins the game. However, if a player rolls a 1, they cannot add the points from that roll to their score and must pass the turn to the other player without recording any points. Therefore, it is essential not to be too greedy and to hold your points by pressing "hold" before rolling a 1 to successfully add them to your score. Have fun!
